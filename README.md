# Make Change Project

## Description
This is my first Java project while at Skill Distillery.
This project takes in the price of an item and the amount paid for that item then calculates how much to give back in denominations of $20, $10, $5, $1, quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies.
To use this program at the start when prompted press '1' to run the machine.
Enter the information for cost of an item and amount tendered.
It will perform the task and return with the amount to be given back.
It will prompt after complete if you would like to run it again by entering '1' or if you would like to turn off by hitting '0'.
